Originally written in 2012, this was an experiment to test the dependency inclusion functionality provided by my JavaScript library (originally called VelocityJS).

VelocityJS
==============

In late 2009, I began writing my own JavaScript library that includes UI components initially named VelocityJS. It's never been released to the public, and it was most recently used for 2 years of prototyping and software development at Green Vision Media.

I've learned a lot since 2009, and would like to eventually release the library to the public.
