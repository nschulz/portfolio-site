<p>I entered the interactive media industry professionally in 2004 as a video editor 
with 3D animation and motion graphics experience. I quickly continued to pursue my 
interest in interaction design through front-end web development by studying HTML5 
and gaining strong object-oriented javascript and CSS experience. I am also proficient 
in object-oriented PHP and MySQL. My diverse background in creating interactive 
experiences include platforms ranging from large format touchscreen entertainment 
systems to mobile devices. I have been a full-time front-end web developer and 
designer since January 2011 and I'm currently designing and implementing a javascript 
framework of my own design.</p>

<p>I am a graduate of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln where I obtained my degree 
in physics with a minor in mathematics. I believe physics and technology are a natural 
pair and that my education in both the classroom and office environments offers a 
unique training in both fields. My desire is to work with a team of individuals who 
are as inspired as me to deliver cutting-edge experiences.</p>

<p>I am currently employed by my own interactive media studio, <a href="http://theomedia.us">Theoretical Media</a>. 
Please feel free to browse my portfolio, and contact me if you would like to hire me.</p>
